                <p>
                REPUBLIC OF ROME is a game that captures 250 years of political history during the Roman Republic, from its appearance on the world stage 
                around the time of the 1st Punic War (264 BC) through its eventual collapse into civil war with the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. Players 
                control factions composed of the leading Senatorial families who compete for state offices, military commands, economic concessions and 
                new adherents. Each player is attempting to become the dominant political force in Rome. However, the Senate must also attend to the affairs of 
                state in a hostile world, necessitating a certain amount of cooperation in the prosecution of wars and the maintenance of public contentment. 
                Failure to do so, especially at the outset when Rome is most vulnerable, may result in the collapse of the Republic. Therefore, the players 
                must not only out maneuver one another, but also defeat the game itself, which constitutes an ever-present opponent scheming to divide 
                and defeat them all. Players are advised to keep the threat of the downfall of the Republic foremost in mind and stand ready to cooperate for the 
                good of the state. Otherwise, the most likely winner will be the game, and all players will be put to the sword!
                </p>
                <p>
                WINNING: There are multiple ways to win REPUBLIC OF ROME. One common way is for the Senators in your Faction to accumulate the most 
                combined Influence by the end of the game. However, if a single Senator can accumulate enough Influence to be elected or appointed Consul 
                for Life, this will usually result in a victory for his Faction. The most difficult and most dramatic way to win is to gain the allegiance of the 
                formidable Roman Legions, Revolt against the State and attempt to take the Senate by force! For more details on Victory Conditions see 1.12.1.
                </p>
                <p>
                LOSING: Be ever watchful as Rome can fall in a myriad of ways! If the State goes Bankrupt due to poor fiscal policy, all players lose. If the 
                citizens of Rome ever Revolt due to the poor stewardship of the Senate, all the players lose. Finally, if, at the end of any turn, Rome is beset by 
                four Active Wars, the Republic will collapse under the strain and Rome will be no more! For more details on the Losing Conditions see 1.12.2.

                attributes that increase a Faction’s voting power and Influence. The 
                black-text Senators represent Families, while the red-text Senators 
                represent specific Statesmen of the era. Statesmen are treated like 
                Senators but usually have better attributes and a special power.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.04.3 PUBLIC AGREEMENTS:</strong>
                    During the course of the Game 
                    players will conduct negotiations and make deals. Deals made 
                    publicly, for all players to hear, are considered binding and must 
                    be honored. If one party to the deal is unable to fulfill his or her side 
                    of the bargain when required, the wronged party can rescind those 
                    aspects of the deal that are still being held (and are therefore 
                    retrievable). However, a player may not back out of a Public 
                    Agreement simply because it is inconvenient. Virtually anything that 
                    does not circumvent the rules can be agreed to in such a deal. However 
                    deals involving the distribution of the Rome and Field Consul offices 
                    amongst the two candidates are never enforceable, nor is any deal 
                    involving an Assassination attempt, or agreements to Revolt or to 
                    remain loyal to Rome. If there is disagreement as to the terms of a 
                    Public Agreement, the other players must honestly and impartially 
                    arbitrate the disagreement, by majority vote if needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EXAMPLE: During the Senate Phase, Chris agrees in open discussion to 
                    give Eve 15 Talents in exchange for Eve’s promise that her Rome Consul will 
                    propose Julius for Censor and vote for his election. Eve does as promised. 
                    However, the Rome Consul calls upon Chris to vote first for his own election, 
                    whereas Chris wants to vote last to assure passage. The measure is defeated 
                    when Paul spends money to buy votes to defeat it. Chris protests that the bargain 
                    was not kept, but the other players agree with Eve that nothing was said about 
                    a specific voting order and the trade stands. Eve is entitled to 15 Talents from 
                    Chris during the next Revenue Phase. Chris gets nothing except heartburn.

                and/or give away their held Faction cards only during the Revolution

                <p><strong>1.05.21 MORTALITY RESOLUTION:</strong> Whenever a Mortality Chit is 
                drawn, the chit indicates that the Senator whose numerical ID matches 
                that of the chit has died. If the named Senator is not in play, there is 
                no effect. In the event you need to draw more than one chit (whether 
                through “Draw 2” chits, combat losses, or events), these chits are laid 
                out and not returned to the cup until the appropriate number of chits 
                have been drawn [EXCEPTION: If a Draw 2 marker is drawn, it is 
                immediately returned to the cup and two more markers are drawn 
                (i.e. it does not stay out)]. It is possible (although unlikely) that a 
                “Draw 2” marker could be redrawn several times in the same turn 
                resulting in three or more deaths in a single turn. Once all the needed 
                Mortality Chits have been drawn, the chits are returned to the cup.

                (1.11.372 and 1.12.3). Any Family card (black-text Senator) that does 
                not have a Faction Leader marker is placed under all other Family

                Any cards held in the eliminated Faction’s hand are discarded and the 
                Faction Treasury is returned to the Bank. If a Faction is not 
                eliminated, but has no Senators left, that player may either quit the 
                Game or draw the top Senator card in the Curia that does not match 
                a played Statesman to use as his new Faction Leader. If there is none,

                <p><strong>1.06.13 PROVINCIAL SPOILS:</strong> Each Governor has the option to roll 
                a die or dice to generate that number of Talents of Provincial Spoils 
                from his Province that turn. A Governor need not pay a negative 
                Provincial Spoils result, but the State must pay for unpaid negative 
                amounts collected by both Personal and State Income rolls during 
                the Debits step (1.06.53) of the Revenue Phase. A Governor need not 
                collect Provincial Spoils produced by his Province, but must make that 
                decision before rolling to determine the amount. A Governor who 
                attempts to collect Provincial Spoils from his Province takes a Corrupt 
                marker and is subject to a possible Minor Prosecution until the end of 
                the first Prosecution Phase after his return to Rome (1.09.41). If using

                <p>
                EXAMPLE: The Governor of Undeveloped Hispania Ulterior takes a Corrupt 
                marker and rolls a 2 for Provincial Spoils, which results in net income of -1 
                (2 - 3 = -1), but he need not pay any negative totals out of his own funds. 
                Total bill to the State Treasury is -1 Talent.

                (yellow-bordered) Province (unless in Revolt) must roll 1d6 to 
                see if that Province has been improved by Roman control. Rebel 
                Governors do not roll for Province development and provinces

                (green) side. The new values listed thereon remain in effect for the rest 
                of the Game. Provinces being attacked by a Barbarian Raids Event,

                the bid. This is repeated until there are no remaining Initiatives. 
                Only those Senators currently in Rome may bid for an extra Initiative 
                with the winning bid coming from a single Personal Treasury. 
                Winning the bid allows the entire Faction to take the Initiative 
                Sequence, not just the winning Senator. If nobody bids for an 
                Initiative, the HRAO’s Faction takes any Initiatives that are not bid on.

                <p><strong>1.07.3 CARDS:</strong> There are two classes of cards: Cards with black text 
                are called Forum cards and must be played face up in the Forum 
                when they are drawn. Cards with red text are called Faction cards 
                and belong to the player who draws them. A Faction card may be 
                held secretly in a player’s possession until he chooses to play it in 
                accordance with any restrictions pertaining to that card.

                <p><strong>1.07.31 SENATORS:</strong> There are two types of Senator cards: Family 
                cards (1.07.311), which are Forum cards, and Statesmen (1.07.312), 
                which are Faction cards. The number after the “MIL” on the right of 
                the card is the Senator’s Military rating, representing his ability as a 
                Commander (general and admiral). The number after the “ORA” is 
                the Oratory rating, representing his political skills and voting power. 
                The number after the “LOY” is his Loyalty rating, measuring the 
                degree of allegiance the Senator feels towards the Faction controlling
                him (1.07.411). The number in the bottom center of the card is his 
                Influence and serves as a fluctuating gauge of his prestige. This rating 
                can be increased during the Game by his public service or reduced by 
                his misdeeds. This number is always positive; a Senator can never 
                have less than 0 Influence. The small number in the upper center 
                of the card is the Senator ID Number, which corresponds to a likenumbered Mortality Chit. Senator cards also contain designated areas 
                to record the Senator’s Popularity and Knight markers. If a Senator’s 
                Popularity is negative, it is recorded with a black Number marker. 
                Popularity may not go above 9 or below -9.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.07.311 FAMILY SENATORS:</strong> Family cards are Senator cards with 
                black text and a marble background that represent leading families in 
                the Senate. New Family cards are added to a Faction only through 
                Persuasion Attempts (1.07.4), when Repopulating Rome (1.09.81) 
                and sometimes when playing a related Statesman card (1.07.312). 
                Having a particular Family card means a player has in his Faction the 
                leading member of that family. Should that Senator die, his place is 
                taken by the next leading member of that family who, if not a Faction 
                Leader, leaves the current Faction and goes to the bottom of the Curia. 
                Family cards with an ID# in brackets “[ ]” include a related prominent 
                Statesman that may appear during play.

                <p><strong>1.07.312 STATESMEN SENATORS:</strong> Senator cards with an alphanumeric ID, red text and a marble background represent outstanding 
                individual Statesmen with special capabilities. Statesmen can enter 
                play only at Game start (3.01.9) or during the Revolution Phase 
                (1.11.1). A player may not add a Statesman card to his Faction if either 
                of the following conditions exist:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>An opponent controls the Statesman’s related (same ID#)
                Family card [EXCEPTION: 25A/B or 29A/B, see below]; or</li>
                <li>A related Statesman with the same ID# is already in play. 
                [EXCEPTION: 25A/B or 29A/B per 1.05.22]</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                When a Statesman enters play, if the player already controls the 7
                related Family card, place the Statesman on top of it. If the related 
                Family card is in the Forum, move the Family card to the player’s 
                Faction and place the Statesman on top of it. The Statesman is placed 
                over it and both cards are moved to that player’s Faction. If the 
                related Family card is in the Curia or deck, place the Statesman by 
                itself in the player's Faction.
                </p>
                <p>
                When a Statesman is already in play and its related Family card 
                appears in the Forum (not the Curia), immediately place it beneath 
                the Statesman.
                </p>
                <p>
                If two Statesmen with the same number are in play legally [25A/B or 
                29A/B per (1.05.22)] and the Family card then appears in the Forum 
                (not the Curia), place the Family card under the “A” Statesman of the 
                pair. A player may not play one of these Statesmen if the Family card 
                is in play with a different Faction, unless the other Statesman of the 
                pair is already in play. If one of the pair dies, and the Family card is 
                with the other, move the Family card to the surviving Statesman, 
                even if the dead Statesman was the Faction Leader.
                </p>
                <p>
                When a Statesman is placed on his Family card, the Statesman takes 
                over any Influence and Popularity ratings on the Family card that 
                are greater than his own and all its Concessions, Governorships, 
                Knights, and other markers. Note that the Statesman's Military, 
                Oratory, and Loyalty ratings which are less than those on the Family 
                card remain equal to the Statesman's printed rating.
                </p>
                <p>
                Statesmen may use their special abilities even while they are away 
                from Rome. Marius must still be in Rome to attract a Knight.

                <p><strong>1.07.32 CONCESSIONS:</strong> Concessions are Faction cards with a picture 
                frame background that represent economic considerations such as 
                collecting taxes or distributing grain. The player who draws it from 
                the deck owns a Concession. He may assign it to one of his Senators 
                at Game start (3.01.9) or during a Revolution Phase (1.11.1) by placing 
                it partially beneath that Senator’s card. That Senator must then 
                collect the number of Talents listed on that Concession during the 
                Revenue Phase (1.06.12) or as otherwise indicated on the Concession 
                card. Generating revenue on a Concession reveals the corrupt bar on 
                that Concession’s card. This indicates that the Senator is liable to a 
                Minor Prosecution during the next Senate Phase. A Senator loses a 
                Concession due to his death (1.05.3), a successful Minor Prosecution
                (1.09.441) or due to certain Wars or Natural Disasters. Whenever a 
                Senator dies or is convicted, his Concessions are returned to the Forum, 
                where they can be awarded to another Senator by a proposal (1.09.61).

                (aka eliminated) (by a War, Leader or Natural Disaster), then it is 
                placed in the Concession space of the Curia and has a chance to be

                <p><strong>1.07.33 WARS:</strong> War cards are Forum cards with a parchment 
                background representing external threats to Rome. The numbers next 
                to the icons on the right of the card represent its value in combat. The 
                number next to the Swords icon is the enemy’s Land Strength, which 
                represents the value of his Army. The number next to the Anchor icon 
                is the Fleet Support number, which indicates the number of Roman 
                Fleets, if any, required to support the War. Some War cards have a 
                number next to a Ship icon, which represents enemy Fleet Strength 
                which must be defeated in a Naval Battle before conducting the Land 
                Battle. The numbers highlighted black and gray next to the D and S 
                on the right of the card determine automatic Disasters and Standoffs 
                and are explained in the Combat section (1.10.21, 1.10.31). The 
                number inside the Coin on the bottom right indicates the Spoils of 
                War that are generated upon defeat of the War and are detailed in the 
                Combat section (1.10.4). Some Wars have a Dying Plant icon, which 
                indicates the War causes a Drought Effect (1.08.12). Some cards have 
                an Armaments icon beside the date, which indicates whether the War 
                is Active or Inactive (1.07.331).
                When a War card with an Armaments icon is drawn, it goes into one 
                of the the “Active Wars” spaces in the Forum [EXCEPTION: 
                Imminent Wars (1.07.3321)]. It usually remains active until the Senate 
                defeats it.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.07.331 INACTIVE WARS:</strong> War cards without an Armaments icon 
                are Inactive Wars. When drawn, place them in the “Inactive Wars” 
                spaces of the Forum [EXCEPTION: Imminent Wars (1.07.3321)]. They 
                remain inactive in the Forum until the Senate sends an Army or Fleet 
                to attack them, or until activated by their Leader (1.07.341) or a 
                Matching War (1.07.3321). Once activated, change the War’s status by 
                moving it to one of the “Active Wars” spaces of the Forum. Some 
                War cards list how many Matching Wars activate them and where 
                they reside within their sequence of Matching Wars.

                <p><strong>1.07.332 MATCHING WARS:</strong> Whenever two Wars of the same type 
                are active (e.g., two Punic Wars or two Cilician Pirates), the Land and 
                Fleet Strength (but not Fleet Support) of each are doubled as long as 
                the two remain active. If a third Matching War is active, the Strength 
                numbers of all three are tripled. If all four Macedonian War cards are 
                active at the same time, their Strength is quadrupled. However, each 
                War is fought individually - not added to its related Wars. In these 
                situations, the Strength numbers of the remaining related Wars are 
                reduced again to tripled, doubled, or normal Strength as their 
                Matching Wars are individually vanquished. When counting Active 
                Wars [4 and Rome is defeated (1.12.2)], each Matching War card 
                (not set) is considered a separate War. Rome may not attack the latter 
                of any currently active Matching Wars unless she first (or 
                simultaneously) prosecutes all earlier (in Matching War Sequence) 
                currently active and related Matching Wars.
                </p>
                <p>
                EXAMPLE: Assume the 1st and 2nd Punic Wars are in the Forum. Rome 
                need not defeat the 1st Punic War in order to attack the 2nd, but she must 
                attack the 1st Punic War in the same turn she attacks the 2nd Punic War.
                </p>
                <p>
                Each Matching War contains a line of text similar to “1st of 2 Cilician 
                Pirates (1)”. The number in () is the number of Wars of that type in 
                the Era of the card (i.e. in the Early, Middle, or Late Republic deck).

                <p><strong>1.07.3321 IMMINENT WARS:</strong> Whenever a War card is drawn from 
                the deck that would match another War or Revolt card already located 
                anywhere in the Forum, the drawn card is placed in the “Imminent 
                Wars” Forum space for the remainder of the current turn, and it 
                does not multiply any Active Wars until it, itself, becomes Active. 
                If the already existing War in the Forum is currently located in an 
                Inactive War space, it is immediately moved to the Active Wars space; 
                otherwise, nothing else happens. At the beginning of each new turn, 
                before any other action is taken, all cards in the Imminent War space are 
                examined, and one card for each War is moved to an Active War space 
                on the Forum (1.05.1). Activate all Imminent Wars in Matching War 
                order (e.g., 1st Macedonian before 2nd Macedonian), even if it means 
                the most recently drawn War card must be activated. Imminent Wars 
                can be attacked by the Senate (just as if they were Inactive); however, 
                the moment the Senate sends a Force to attack the Imminent War, it 
                is instantly moved to the Active War column and begins to multiply 
                War Strengths. Once played in the Imminent Wars space the War will 
                only be moved out of that box at the beginning of a turn or if attacked 
                by the Senate; Leaders (1.07.34) do not active Imminent Wars. For the 
                brief period the Wars are located in the Imminent Wars space they are 
                considered Inactive, regardless of their Armaments icon.
                </p>
                <p>
                EXAMPLE: First Punic War begins the turn in an Inactive War slot. Third 
                Punic War is drawn; it is placed in the Imminent War space, and the 1st 
                Punic War is moved to an Active War space. The 2nd Punic War is drawn 
                in the same turn; it is also placed in the Imminent War space. The Hannibal 
                Leader card is then drawn; it is immediately placed with the active 1st Punic 
                War. At the start of Turn 2, the 2nd Punic War is moved to an Active War 
                space, but the 3rd Punic War remains Inactive until the start of Turn 3.

                <p><strong>1.07.333 REVOLTS:</strong> A Revolt is a type of War card in which no 
                Spoils of War are created by defeating the War. Many Revolts are 
                conditional (i.e., they are treated as Revolts if a named Province 
                currently exists at the time of being drawn, but are treated as Wars 
                that are not Revolts if it does not). Whenever the last War in a 
                numbered series of Matching Wars is defeated, any previous War in 
                that series is thereafter treated as a Revolt.
                </p>
                <p>
                EXAMPLE: If the 3rd Punic War is defeated, the 1st and 2nd Punic Wars 
                are considered Revolts.

                <p><strong>1.07.334 WAR CONSEQUENCES:</strong> A War need not be fought 
                immediately, but for each Active War during the Revenue Phase, the 
                State loses 20 Talents (1.06.53). If, at the end of any Combat Phase, 
                there are 4 Active Wars, the Republic collapses and all players lose 
                (1.12.2). Any Active War in one of the “Unprosecuted War” spaces 
                (1.10.9) also increases the Unrest by 1 each during every Population 
                Phase (1.08.11), in addition to costing 20 Talents. Inactive or 
                Imminent Wars do not count against the four-war limit, the State 
                Treasury drain, or Unrest.

                drawn while any Punic Wars are Active or Inactive), the Leader is 
                immediately placed with the War and the War is considered Active 
                [EXCEPTION: Leaders cannot activate Imminent Wars (1.07.3321)]. 
                If a Leader resides in the Curia and a War matching that Leader is 
                drawn (or moves from Imminent to Active), both the Leader and the

                are removed from the deck and board the Leader is removed from

                made for each Leader in the Curia. If the result is a 5 or 6, that Leader 
                dies and is removed from play. On the Refuge / Rise from Refuge 
                Event “killed by a Victory” refers to a Leader who was aiding a War 
                card and was either removed from play or moved to the Curia due to 
                a Victory result (1.10.4) or the New Alliance / Another New Alliance

                EXAMPLE: Fabius wishes to make a Persuasion Attempt against Claudius, 
                who is an Unaligned Senator in the Forum. Fabius adds his Oratory and 
                Influence ratings and gets a sum of 7, from which he subtracts Claudius’ 
                Loyalty rating of 7 to produce a Base Number of 0. Fabius spends 9 Talents 
                from his Personal Treasury to bring the Base Number up to 9. Play then 
                moves around the table, and the other players spend a total of 8 Talents from 
                their collective Faction Treasuries to lower the Base Number to 1. Fabius 
                responds by spending the 7 Talents remaining in his Personal Treasury to 
                raise the Base Number to 8. Play revolves around the table again, but this 
                time the other players are unwilling or unable to spend any more money, so 
                the final Base Number is 8. Fabius rolls a 9, which is not less than or equal to 
                8, so the Persuasion Attempt fails and Claudius remains uncommitted. All
                the money spent on the Persuasion Attempt is placed in Claudius’ Personal 
                Treasury, making him both more attractive and harder to get, since the 24 
                Talents now in his Personal Treasury are automatically added to his Loyalty

                places the Manpower Shortage marker onto the Force Pool and is 
                cumulative with any existing Manpower Shortage (1.07.21). “Mob” 
                results in an assault on the Senate by an outraged mob, which is 
                resolved by drawing six Mortality Chits to check among those 
                currently in Rome to determine the Senators killed (1.05.21). “People 
                Revolt” results in an overthrow of the Senatorial government and 
                immediate defeat for all players, unless a Rebel is currently in Revolt, 
                in which case he wins the Game [barring loss due to four Wars].

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.1 HOW THE SENATE PHASE WORKS:</strong> The Senate Phase is 
                the heart of the Game. Players will put forward a variety of proposals 
                which will then be voted on by Senators and enacted if passed. The 
                Senate is convened the moment the State of the Republic dice are 
                thrown in the Population Phase.
                </p>
                <p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> Each player should readjust his Vote Tally dial as soon as he 
                gains or loses votes for any reason.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.11 HIGHEST RANKING AVAILABLE OFFICIAL (HRAO):</strong> The 
                HRAO is the highest ranking available official in Rome. The order of 
                precedence is listed on their Office Marker:
                <ol>
                <li>Dictator,</li>
                <li>Rome Consul,</li>
                <li>Field Consul,</li>
                <li>Censor,</li>
                <li>Master of Horse,</li>
                <li>Pontifex Maximus (2.01).</li>
                </ol>
                If none of these officials is available due to death or absence from 
                Rome, the Aligned Senator with the most Influence in Rome opens 
                the meeting (using Oratory ratings and then lowest ID# to break ties). 
                All Senators in Rome [i.e., everyone except Governors (1.09.5), 
                Proconsuls (1.10.8), Captives (1.10.71) and Rebel Senators (1.11.3)] 
                must attend the Senate meeting.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.12 PRESIDING MAGISTRATE:</strong> The HRAO is typically the 
                Presiding Magistrate. The HRAO will not be the Presiding Magistrate 
                during Prosecutions (1.09.41) or after stepping down as a result of a 
                unanimous proposal defeat (1.09.144). The Presiding Magistrate has 
                complete control over the procedures of the Senate and conducts 
                all business. He may recognize Senators in any order he wishes and 
                may call for the votes of each Faction in any order. He alone makes 
                nominations and proposals without the use of a Tribune card 
                (1.09.151), and he may break off discussion on any proposal by calling 
                for an immediate vote. Any player who ignores his demand for an 
                immediate vote is considered to have abstained and loses his right 
                to vote on that proposal. After all elections (including Governors) 
                and Prosecutions, he may close the meeting at any time there is no 
                unresolved proposal on the floor by saying “the Senate is adjourned.” 
                If the Presiding Magistrate dies as a result of an Assassination or 
                Prosecution, the next HRAO becomes Presiding Magistrate.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.13 PROPOSALS:</strong> A proposal is anything put before the Senate 
                for a vote (except a Prosecution, see 1.09.41), either by the Presiding 
                Magistrate, a Tribune, or as otherwise allowed. A nomination is a 
                type of proposal. Whenever a vote is not in progress, any player may 
                offer advice, discuss options, and/or suggest courses of action, but 
                only the Presiding Magistrate or a Tribune can formally define a 
                proposal. Only the Presiding Magistrate may call for votes.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.131 PROPOSAL ALTERATION:</strong> Defeated proposals may not be 
                introduced again in the same Senate Phase without significant change.
                </p>
                <p>
                EXAMPLES:
                <ul>
                <li>A proposal to assign Fabius 8 Legions fails. A subsequent 
                proposal to assign Fabius 7 Legions or Claudius 8 
                Legions may be put forward.</li>
                <li>A proposal to send Fabius to govern Hispania Citerior 
                and Claudius to Sicilia might fail as a joint proposal but a 
                subsequent separate proposal to send Fabius to 
                Hispania Citerior is legal.</li>
                <li>A proposal to nominate Fabius and Claudius as Consuls 
                fails. A Subsequent proposal to nominate Claudius and 
                Fabius as Consuls would be illegal (rewording the 
                proposal is not enough).</li>
                </ul>
                In contrast, Concessions (1.09.61) and Consul for Life 
                nominations (1.09.82) can only be voted upon once per turn.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.14 VOTING:</strong> After announcing the proposal, the Presiding 
                Magistrate chooses a Faction to vote first. That Faction must vote, 
                abstain, or use a Tribune to veto the vote (1.09.151). After that Faction 
                votes or abstains, the Presiding Magistrate selects another Faction 
                to vote, and the process is repeated until all Factions have had an 
                opportunity to vote, abstain, or the proposal is vetoed. The voting 
                procedure of the Senate is the same for all business requiring a vote 
                except that abstaining is not allowed during the passage or repeal of 
                a Land Bill (1.09.62); any player refusing to vote on a Land Bill when 
                prompted is considered to have voted against it (or for its repeal).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.141 VOTES:</strong> Each Senator in Rome controls votes equal to his 
                Oratory plus the number of Knights he controls. However, he may 
                temporarily increase his votes for any particular proposal or 
                Prosecution (1.09.41) by buying them. For each Talent he pays out of 
                his Personal Treasury he receives 1 extra vote for that round of voting. 
                These Talents are paid out when the Senator’s votes are called upon.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.142 BLOCK VOTES:</strong> All the Senators in a Faction need not vote 
                alike, though they usually will. Once a player declares his vote, he 
                may not change it, nor play a Tribune to veto (cancel) the vote.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.143 PASSAGE:</strong> A simple majority (> 50%) of votes cast is required 
                to pass any measure (i.e. a proposal, Prosecution (1.09.41), or 
                anything else requiring a vote), except recalling a Pontifex Maximus.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.144 LOSS OF INFLUENCE:</strong> Whenever the Presiding Magistrate 
                makes a proposal which is defeated by unanimous vote of all 
                Senators in Rome controlled by the other players, he may choose 
                to lose 1 Influence (down to a minimum of 0) or he may step down 
                as Presiding Magistrate and immediately hand over conduct of the 
                meeting to the next HRAO. If the Presiding Magistrate does not have 
                any Influence to lose he must step down as Presiding Magistrate. The 
                Senator stepping down retains his office, but is not available to be the 
                Presiding Magistrate at any further point in the turn. This does not 
                affect the HRAO order, just who is the Presiding Magistrate. This can 
                happen multiple times during a Senate Phase. These penalties do not 
                apply when a Tribune is used to put forth a proposal (1.09.151).

                <p><strong>1.09.15 TRIBUNES:</strong> Tribune cards may be played during the Senate 
                Phase to veto or initiate proposals, including nominations. Once used, 
                Tribunes are discarded. If two or more players play a Tribune at the 
                same time, those players dice off to determine who gets precedence 
                with the loser(s) taking their Tribune(s) back to their hand(s). Players 
                may play Tribune cards even if they have no Senators in Rome.

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.151 PROPOSAL USING A TRIBUNE:</strong> Players may force 
                proposals to a vote by using a Tribune card and announcing 
                “Tribune!”. A proposal is considered on the floor the moment the 
                first vote is called for. The Presiding Magistrate may call for the votes 
                of each Faction in any order. The proposal must still be made at the 
                correct time in the Senate Phase (e.g., a player may not propose to 
                recruit Legions before the Censor has been elected). This may be 
                done any time there is no proposal already on the floor. 
                Alternatively, it can be played during a current proposal with or 
                without specifying intent so as to establish that player’s right to 
                make the next proposal. Other facts about Tribunes:
                <ul>
                <li>A Tribune may not be used to interrupt an already 
                played Tribune (i.e., once a Tribune has been played to 
                make a proposal, another Tribune may not interrupt it).</li>
                <li>A Prosecution is not considered a proposal and is 
                therefore not eligible to be proposed (though they may 
                be vetoed).</li>
                <li>A Tribune can also be played immediately after the 
                Presiding Magistrate adjourns the Senate to force its 
                continuation to consider the Tribune’s proposal.</li>
                <li>A Tribune may not be used to make a proposal to 
                adjourn the Senate; however, a proposal could be put 
                forth to send the Presiding Magistrate to war, which, 
                if it passes, would close the Senate upon the Presiding 
                Magistrate’s departure (1.09.642).</li>
                <li>A Tribune can be used in the middle of a vote that 
                would send the Presiding Magistrate off to war (thus 
                closing the Senate Phase) before or during his turn to 
                vote - not as a veto, but as a measure to suspend the vote 
                until after his proposal has been acted upon. (1.09.642)</li>
                <li>Some Statesmen have the capability of playing 
                an inherent Tribune each turn without actually 
                playing a card. Treat this ability exactly the 
                same as if the Faction had played a Tribune card.</li>

                <p><strong>1.09.152 VETO USING A TRIBUNE:</strong> A Tribune may be used prior 
                to or during the owning Faction’s turn to vote to stop any vote from
                being taken, whether it is an election, Prosecution, or other proposal 
                [EXCEPTIONS: Consul for Life, Special Prosecution of Assassins, 
                any proposal by a Dictator, and the appointment of the last eligible 
                candidate for any office]. The player playing the Tribune announces 
                “Veto,” and the vote is cancelled, even if it already had enough votes 
                for passage. The slate of candidates in a vetoed election may not be 
                nominated again in the same turn, nor may the Accused in a vetoed 
                Prosecution be prosecuted again that turn for the same reason.

                elected or defeated as a pair; one cannot be elected while the other is 
                defeated in the same vote. The current Consuls and Dictator (if any) 
                may not be elected Consul this turn until the Tradition Erodes Law is 
                passed. A Senator may not hold two offices simultaneously, but the

                and takes over conduct of the meeting. The outgoing Consuls receive

                at least 20, which could be a Civil War (1.11.3), a Dictator may be 
                elected or appointed immediately after the Consular elections. A 
                Naval Victory marker reduces the Naval Strength of a War to 0 for 
                this purpose. To be eligible for Dictator, a Senator must be Aligned,

                as Dictator. If there is only one Consul present because the other has

                Presiding Magistrate calls for such elections (which may be vetoed). 
                A Dictator may also be proposed via the use of 
                a Tribune at this time (after the Consuls decline 
                to make a joint appointment). The Presiding

                continue to try to elect a Dictator even after 
                multiple failures; however, once a Censor is 
                elected (1.09.4) a Dictator nomination may no

                <p><strong>1.09.33 TERM:</strong> The new Dictator becomes Presiding Magistrate, takes 
                the Dictator marker, increases his Influence by 7, and appoints as his 
                Master of Horse any Aligned Senator in Rome not already holding an 
                office (except Censor). That Senator takes the Master of Horse marker 
                and increases his Influence by 3. The Dictator’s proposals cannot be 
                vetoed, though all proposals must still be voted upon normally. The 
                term of the Dictator and his Master of Horse lasts until the Consular 
                elections of the next Game Turn, at which time both the Dictator and 
                his Master of Horse must immediately surrender their offices [unless 
                already in revolt(1.11.3)] and the Dictator (not the Master of Horse) 
                takes a Prior Consul marker. The Dictator (or another Senator) may 
                be immediately appointed/elected Dictator again, assuming the War

                <p><strong>1.09.34 MASTER OF HORSE:</strong> Whenever the Dictator commands 
                a Force, he is accompanied by his Master of Horse. The Dictator’s 
                Military rating for any combat is the sum of his Military rating and 
                that of his Master of Horse. The Master of Horse 
                must accompany the Dictator to War and 
                cannot act independently of the Dictator; until 
                the Dictator dies in combat or Revolts (1.11.3), 
                the Master of Horse must remain loyal to the 
                Dictator. If victorious in a War, the Dictator 
                receives the usual increase in his Influence and 
                Popularity (1.10.4), while the Master of Horse 
                gets nothing. If the Dictator is defeated, the Master of Horse is killed 
                along with him. The Master of Horse can also be killed by a Mortality 
                Chit draw during a battle result (1.10.7). The Master of Horse adds to 
                the Commander’s Military rating in a Naval Battle (reflecting the 
                greater efficiency of a unified command), but cannot be used to 
                nullify a Disaster or Standoff result in any battle (1.10.21, 1.10.31).

                <p><strong>1.09.4 CENSOR:</strong> Immediately after the election of the new Consuls 
                and the option to appoint or elect a Dictator, the Presiding Magistrate 
                conducts elections for Censor. Eligible candidates for Censor must 
                have a Prior Consul marker, must be an 
                Aligned Senator in Rome, and must not hold an 
                existing Major Office except for Censor. If only 
                one eligible candidate of Consular experience is 
                available (as usually happens on the first turn), 
                he is appointed automatically. If there are no 
                Senators with Consular experience present in 
                the Senate and free of other offices, the election 
                for Censor is temporarily thrown open to all Aligned Senators in 
                Rome. Each time a Censor is elected or appointed, the Censor marker 
                is placed on that Senator’s card and his Influence increases by 5. The 
                Presiding Magistrate now turns the conduct of the meeting over to 
                the Censor temporarily to conduct any Prosecutions (1.09.41).

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>1.09.41 PROSECUTIONS:</strong> The Censor either declares no Prosecutions 
                and returns conduct of the meeting to the Presiding Magistrate 
                or announces a Prosecution. He may conduct up to two Minor or one 
                Major Prosecution each turn in addition to any Special Major 
                Prosecutions of Assassins. During Prosecutions the Censor is the 
                Presiding Magistrate and conducts all voting. If he suffers a unanimous 
                defeat, he may either lose the required Influence (1.09.144) or hand 
                control of the meeting back to the previous Presiding Magistrate and 
                end all Prosecutions. A Censor may not Prosecute himself 
                [EXCEPTION: Special Major Prosecutions of Assassins (1.09.74)]. 
                Only Senators in Rome may be Prosecuted. If the Censor dies as a 
                result of an Assassination while the Prosecutions are ongoing, all 
                unresolved Prosecutions fail and the meeting returns to the Presiding 
                Magistrate.

                may appeal to the people when his Faction is called upon to vote. He 
                rolls 2d6 and modifies it by his Popularity and finds the result on the 
                Popular Appeal Table. All negative votes are added to the votes “for” 
                conviction; all positive votes gained are added to the votes “against” 
                conviction. “Accused Killed” means the populace is so disgusted by 
                the self-serving rhetoric of the Accused that they kill him themselves. 
                If the Accused is killed in this way, the Accused is considered to have 
                been guilty, and the Prosecutor still gains his Prior Consul marker 
                (if any) and half of his Influence, as usual (1.09.44). Conversely, a 
                result of “Accused Freed” ends the Prosecution with an acquittal. In 
                addition, one Mortality Chit is drawn for each number which exceeds 
                11 on the modified roll in order to see if either the Censor and/or the 
                Prosecutor (the only two vulnerable to the chit draw) is killed by a

                still counts towards the Censor’s total allowed Prosecutions for that 
                Game Turn. A Prosecution is not considered to be a proposal and 
                therefore cannot be proposed with a Tribune. A Senator who makes a 
                Popular Appeal and is not killed as a result may play a Tribune to veto

                to be a reason for Prosecution, e.g. if the Accused has been convicted 
                and thus lost all of his Concessions (1.09.441 and 1.09.442), none of 
                his prior corrupt Concessions is a valid reason for a second

                conduct other business by proposing whatever motions he wishes. 
                Each proposal may consist of only one kind of proposal at a time. For 
                example, a proposal could not group a Land Bill with a Concession 
                vote to increase the chances of passage. Proposals of the same type 
                may always be grouped together [EXCEPTION: Land Bills (1.09.62)]. 
                The Presiding Magistrate may close the meeting whenever he chooses, 
                as long as there is no unresolved motion on the floor. He simply 
                states “the Senate is adjourned” and thereby ends the opportunity for 
                Assassinations (1.09.7). The closing of the Senate cannot be vetoed 
                and does not require a vote; however a Tribune can be used to 
                temporarily keep the Senate open in order to introduce a single 
                proposal (1.09.151).

                <p><strong>1.09.61 ASSIGN CONCESSIONS:</strong> Proposals may be made to assign 
                a specific Concession from the Forum to a specific Aligned Senator 
                present in Rome. Group proposals may be made to simultaneously 
                assign different Concessions to different Senators to increase voting 
                support. If a proposal to assign a Concession fails (whether singly or 
                as part of a group), that Concession card is flipped over to indicate 
                that it may not be proposed again during the same Game Turn. 
                There is no limit to the number of Concessions a Senator may 
                control. The Land Commission Concession may only be assigned if a 
                Land Bill is in effect; once assigned it must be returned to the Forum 
                if there are no Land Bills in effect at the end of a Senate Phase.

                <p><strong>1.09.62 LAND BILLS:</strong> The Senate can improve the Unrest Level by 
                passing Land Bills. Three kinds are available; Type I is a one-turn, 
                single payment measure costing 20 Talents, while Types II and III are 
                permanent measures requiring payments of 5 and 10 Talents every 
                turn, but lowering the Unrest Level only during the turn of their 
                passage. The Senate may propose no more than one Land Bill of each 
                Type per turn. The number of Land Bills that may be in effect at one 
                time is limited by the number of such markers available.
                </p>
                <p>
                A Land Bill proposal must name two consenting Senators in Rome as 
                Sponsor and Co-Sponsor. If the Land Bill passes, lower the Unrest 
                Level and raise the Popularity of the Sponsor and Co-Sponsor as 
                indicated on the Land Bills Table. Place the appropriate Land Bill 
                marker in the applicable box of the State Revenue as a reminder 
                of funds owed by the State during the Revenue Phase (1.06.53). 
                Every Senator who votes against a Land Bill lowers his Popularity as 
                indicated on the Land Bills Table. Popularity changes for Sponsoring, 
                Co-Sponsoring, and Voting are cumulative. Senators of a player who 
                vetoes a Land Bill with a Tribune are not penalized.

                <p><strong>1.09.621 REPEALS:</strong> The Senate may attempt to repeal a Type II or 
                III Land Bill (not a Type I), even on the same turn it passed. A 
                Senator in Rome must volunteer to Sponsor the repeal, and he must 
                have Popularity equal to or greater than the amount he will lose 
                by sponsoring and voting for the repeal. The Sponsor lowers his 
                Popularity as indicated on the Land Bills Table and must vote for that 
                repeal. Popularity losses for Sponsoring and Voting are cumulative. 
                If the repeal passes, raise the Unrest Level as indicated on the Land 
                Bills Table. Senators who vote for the repeal lower their Popularity 
                accordingly. Only one Land Bill repeal may be attempted per turn.

                consequences to his Faction as would normally occur due to a caught 
                Assassin (1.09.74). Regardless of the outcome, the vote on the Land

                and placed in the Active Forces boxes. The State Treasury must

                he is immediately absent from Rome and placed overlapping the War.

                the Field Consul, the Rome Consul and the Dictator (with the Master 
                of Horse) can be sent to War. The Field Consul must be sent to War

                if they do so, each Force must attack separately, one at a time, until 
                the War is defeated or all Forces have attacked. The advantage of 
                sending separate Forces to fight a single War is that each Disaster and

                the vote (as long as he voted before he died). A Land Bill vote is 
                never cancelled by the death of a Senator, whether he is Sponsor or

                <p><strong>1.09.73 BODYGUARDS:</strong> If the target Senator has one or more “Secret 
                Bodyguard” cards, he may announce after the roll how many of 
                those cards he will play to defend against the Assassination attempt. 
                Each Bodyguard so used subtracts 1 from the roll and is discarded 
                after use. The Open Bodyguard card must be in play prior to an 
                Assassination attempt to have any effect. If the Assassin is not caught, 
                for each Bodyguard card played, the Assassin must roll again with all 
                applicable modifiers solely to determine if he is caught. It is therefore 
                possible for the first roll to kill the victim and a subsequent roll to 
                result in the Assassin’s capture.

                <p><strong>1.09.74 PUNISHMENT:</strong> A caught Assassin is killed. In addition, his 
                Faction Leader loses 5 Influence and, if he is in Rome, is the subject 
                of an immediate Special Major Prosecution, in which he MUST 
                make a Popular Appeal (1.09.421). However, instead of modifying 
                the Popular Appeal roll by his own Popularity, he must subtract 
                the Popularity of the target Senator. So, if the target had negative 
                Popularity, add it to the roll. The Censor is Presiding Magistrate for a 
                Special Major Prosecution, even if he is the Accused Faction Leader. If 
                there is no Censor, the current Presiding Magistrate runs the vote. A 
                Prosecutor is not selected for this Special Major Prosecution. Influence 
                of the Accused is counted as normal. A Special Major Prosecution 
                only temporarily suspends the current proposal; the proposal 
                continues after the Prosecution is resolved, if possible. If the Faction 
                Leader is found guilty he is killed and any Family card belonging to 
                the Faction Leader goes to the bottom of the Curia. If guilty, in 
                addition to his own death, a number of Mortality Chits equal to 
                the target’s Popularity (if positive) are drawn, and other members of 
                the Assassin’s Faction currently in Rome whose chits are drawn are 
                also implicated and killed. If the caught Assassin was the Faction 
                Leader he is automatically killed, and any Family card belonging to 
                the Faction Leader goes to the bottom of the Curia. There is no 
                Special Major Prosecution but chits are drawn as above to implicate 
                additional Faction members. The Faction is eliminated if it loses its 
                last Senator via Punishment for trying an Assassination (1.05.4).

                    HRAO or the Presiding Magistrate. He may look at a non-rebel 
                    player’s hand at any time, but may not play any of the other player’s 
                    cards. He may not force other Factions to make Assassination 
                    attempts, to make any Public Agreements or to vote against a Land 
                    Bill. He may not become a Rebel (1.11.3, 1.11.32), although he may be 
                    in the Rebel Faction. Only the Faction with the Primary Rebel may
                    vote normally and conduct Assassination attempts. Note that players 
                    will regain control of their Factions if the Consul for Life dies, but not 
                    if he is Captured. If a Civil War is already ongoing, the Rebel can still

                    appointed – otherwise the Consul for Life will win the Game at the

                    Fleets are present to meet or exceed the Fleet Support of the War. In 
                    Land battles the Commander adds his Military rating to the Strength 
                    of his Army. Army Strength equals the number of Legions in the Army 
                    with Veteran Legions (1.10.5) counting double. The points added by 
                    the Commander’s Military rating cannot be greater than the Strength

                <p><strong>1.10.12 NAVAL BATTLES:</strong> Those Wars that 
                    show a Fleet Strength (i.e. a number next to the 
                    Ship icon) require two separate battles, one 
                    Naval Battle and one Land Battle. The enemy 
                    Fleet Strength must be defeated before his land 
                    Forces may be attacked. A Naval Battle is the 
                    same as Land Battle except that the number of 
                    Fleets, rather than Legions, is counted. War cards whose Fleets have 
                    been defeated are marked with a Naval Victory marker. Once the 
                    enemy Fleets are defeated, any Legions still present may (at the 
                    discretion of the Commander) immediately attack the Land Strength 
                    of the War (1.10.11) in the same Combat Phase, provided there are still    
                    sufficient Fleets in the Force to support the Army and the 
                    Commander was neither killed (1.10.7) nor captured (1.10.71) in the 
                    Fleet Battle. If the Land Battle is not won, the Naval Battle need not be 
                    re-fought in subsequent turns. The War can be won in subsequent 
                    turns by defeating only the enemy Land Strength. Consequently, the 
                    Senate may decide to send no Legions to conduct such a War, 
                    endeavoring to defeat the enemy Fleets in one turn and its Land 
                    Strength in a subsequent turn. If Rome sends a Fleet with no Legions, 
                    the Commander and his Force return to Rome immediately if 
                    victorious. If the Senate attempts to win both the Naval and Land 
                    Battles in the same turn, it must send a combined Force of Fleets and 
                    Legions, and must first defeat the enemy fleets. Accompanying 
                    Legions could be lost in the ensuing Naval Battle (1.10.61).

                <p><strong>1.10.4 VICTORY:</strong> A Land “Victory” lowers the Unrest Level by 1 
                    and eliminates the War. A Naval “Victory” also lowers the Unrest 
                    Level by 1 and results in a Naval Victory marker being placed on the 
                    War. The Roman Force loses the number of Legions and Fleets (if it 
                    has them) indicated on the Combat Results Table and the surviving 
                    Forces remain on the Commander’s card, provided the Commander 
                    survives (1.10.7). In some cases one or more Provinces will be created 
                    and placed in the Forum. The victorious Commander increases both 
                    his Popularity and Influence by half (fractions rounded up) of the 
                    unmodified (printed) Land or Fleet War Strength number (or both, 
                    if both were defeated in this turn by the same Commander). Players 
                    should increase the State Treasury for Spoils of War by an amount 
                    equal to the number inside the Coin on the bottom right of the card 
                    (except for Naval Battles). Revolts do not yield Spoils of War.
                </p>
                <p>EXAMPLE: Marius is dispatched with 9 Legions to deal with the Gladiator 
                    Revolt that is matched with the Leader Spartacus. Marius’ Military rating of 
                    4 is added to the number of his 9 Legions, for a total Strength of 13. If Marius 
                    had only 3 Legions, he could only add 3 from his Military rating (1.10.11). 
                    The Land Strength on the Gladiator Revolt card is 6, which is increased to 
                    11 because the appropriate Leader card, Spartacus, happens to be in play. 13 
                    minus 11 is 2. The player controlling Marius then rolls 3d6, rolling a 10, 
                    which is added to the base of 2 for a final result of 12. A 12 on the Combat 
                    Results Table is a “Stalemate” with a loss of 1 Legion and 1 Fleet. Marius 
                    loses 1 Legion (he has no Fleets), and must draw 1 Mortality Chit to check 
                    for his own death (1.10.7). Had he had a Fleet to lose, he would have had to 
                    draw 2 Mortality Chits. The Gladiator Revolt may be fought again during 
                    the next Combat Phase. Had the Combat roll been 11 or 6, the result would 
                    have been a “Disaster” with the loss of 5 Legions. Had the Combat roll been 
                    a 14 or 16, the result would have been a “Standoff” with the loss of 3 Legions.

                    survivors of a Land Battle that is a Stalemate, 
                    Standoff, or Victory is transformed into a Veteran 
                    Legion by flipping it to its Veteran side. A Senate

                    Senate Defeat, and one surviving Legion (if any) on 
                    each side in a Civil War Stalemate also becomes 
                    Veteran. Veterans are not created in Naval Battles. The 
                    corresponding Legion Allegiance marker is placed on 
                    the Commander’s card until he dies or the Legion is 
                    eliminated. The Legion will remain a Veteran Legion until

                    it is disbanded (2.04.2), even if it is placed under another

                    In a Senate Victory, Civil War Stalemate, or Senate Defeat (1.11.37), 
                    draw a number of Mortality Chits equal to the units lost from (only)

                    belonging to the present Commander or Master of Horse is drawn, 
                    that Senator is killed (1.05.3) or captured (1.10.71). Mortality Chits 
                    belonging to other Senators have no effect. A Commander who loses

                    or reappointed as Dictator. If the Dictator is killed and the Master of 
                    Horse survives, the Master of Horse immediately returns to Rome and 
                    relinquishes his office. If Provincial Forces (2.02) or Rebel Governor

                    not automatically follow the Rebel. Legions that do not follow the 
                    Rebel Senator return to the Active Forces boxes. Since it is assumed 
                    that the Rebel has already returned to Italy with his Army, Fleets 
                    play no role in a Civil War and any Fleets that started with the Rebel

                <p><strong>1.11.32 SECONDARY REBELS:</strong> When a Senator Revolts, 
                    after the Primary Rebel has been determined, each other 
                    Senator in his Faction must immediately declare his 
                    loyalty to the State or join him in Revolt. Those who 
                    remain loyal to the State may continue to function and collect 
                    Revenue normally. Those who join the Revolt leave Rome but lose all 
                    Offices (except Governorships) and Senatorial income (1.11.34), and 
                    share the fate of the Primary Rebel should he be defeated (1.11.371). 
                    The Primary Rebel can use any money in the Secondary Rebels’ 
                    Personal Treasuries as if it were his own. Governors that join the 
                    Revolt keep their Provinces, but except for Veteran Legions owing 
                    allegiance to Senators, in the Basic Game, Garrisons of Rebel 
                    Governors are not available to (and do not require maintenance 
                    from) the Primary Rebel or the Senate. Veteran Legions owing 
                    allegiance to the Primary Rebel or a Secondary Rebel follow the 
                    Primary Rebel in Revolt without maintenance. Secondary Rebels 
                    with independent commands may not contribute other Forces to the 
                    Rebel at this time and must return their non-Garrison Legions and 
                    Fleets to Senate control (to the Active Forces boxes if Victorious). 
                    [EXCEPTION: Rebel Governor Advanced Rule (2.03)] Secondary 
                    Rebels are no longer Proconsuls. In the case of the Master of Horse 
                    with a Rebel Dictator, the Master of Horse may become a Secondary 
                    Rebel only if he is in the same Faction as the Dictator. This allows the 
                    Master of Horse to continue to add his Military rating to the 
                    Dictator’s Military Strength.

                <p><strong>1.11.33 MAINTENANCE:</strong> Rebel Legions & Fleets cost 2 Talents 
                    per turn to maintain and must be paid before the Redistribution of 
                    wealth occurs (1.06.3). The Rebel Senator can pay this from his 
                    Personal or Faction Treasury. Rebel Governors may collect Provincial 
                    Spoils from Provinces, as well as all State and Local Taxes as 
                    Personal Revenue before paying maintenance costs (Advanced Rule 
                    2.03.5). Veteran Legions owing allegiance to a Rebel Senator (and all 
                    Garrisons of Rebel Governors in the Basic Game) require no 
                    maintenance, while Veteran Legions owing no allegiance must be 
                    maintained normally. If the Rebel cannot pay the required 
                    maintenance during the Revenue Phase, he must release the Legions 
                    and Fleets he cannot afford. Any Legions or Fleets that are released 
                    in this manner immediately return to the Senate. If the HRAO does not 
                    wish to pay the maintenance costs of these Forces, or if the Senate 
                    cannot afford them, they are immediately eliminated (1.06.53).

                    and forfeits all Personal Revenue (1.06.1). In the Basic Game, a 
                    Governor in Revolt may not take any Provincial Spoils (1.06.13), and 
                    Rebel Provinces do not produce State Income (1.06.51). A Senator in 
                    Revolt may not receive money directly from any Faction Treasury or 
                    any loyal Senator’s Personal Treasury; however, loyal Senators of his 
                    Faction may still contribute to the Rebel Senator’s Faction Treasury.

                    Strength of the Legions in his Army and the Military rating of the 
                    Primary Rebel Senator (which can never be higher than the Strength

                    dies or is captured, he may not prosecute any more battles. If he is 
                    unable to bring the number of active wars to fewer than 4 because he 
                    lacks the necessary Fleets to support his Army to continue 
                    prosecuting Wars, or does not gain a Victory after each battle, all

                    allows the holder to assign Priesthoods and veto proposals without a 
                    Tribune. This Advanced Rule adds minimal complexity and is highly

                <p><strong>2.01.2 ELECTION:</strong> Unlike normal offices, the Pontifex Maximus 
                    office is held for life unless it is stripped by a Senate vote, multiple 
                    Evil Omens, or Prosecution. If, during the Senate Phase, no Senator 
                    holds the Pontifex Maximus office, a Pontifex Maximus is elected 
                    immediately after the two Consuls but before a Dictator appointment 
                    or election, to look after Rome’s religious affairs. The candidate 
                    must be an Aligned Senator in Rome. The elected Senator places the 
                    Pontifex Maximus marker on his card and increases his Influence by 
                    5, but gains no further Influence in succeeding turns for holding the

                    immediately places a Priest marker on his card and increases his 
                    Influence by 1. A Senator may hold only one Priest marker, but this 
                    does not bar him from holding any other office. When a Priesthood 
                    is reassigned, the Senator who loses the office must decrease his

                    a Major marker, and loses 5 Influence (to a minimum of 0). If he is 
                    unable to pay the full Evil Omens cost, the difference plus a 10 Talent 
                    fine is levied on his Faction Treasury (payable to the Bank). If the

                    any regular Prosecutions the Censor may wish to conduct. The State

                    be supplemented by the Governor, but are never decreased or stolen. 
                    Local Taxes must be spent the turn they are generated and cannot be

                    Strength and Garrisons (1.09.646), plus its Provincial Army Strength 
                    (2.02.32), plus the Military rating of its Governor. If the War requires 
                    only a Land Battle, Provincial Fleets are not required but must be 
                    fully committed to battle, if available (i.e., they may take losses). If the 
                    War requires Fleet Support, a Province lacking the necessary Fleets 
                    to support its battle against a War must still attack, but any “Victory” 
                    result obtained is treated as a “Stalemate” instead (losses remain the 
                    same). Any War requiring a Naval Battle that cannot be fought results 
                    in an automatic ”Defeat.” Combat is resolved in the normal fashion,

                    the battle (in which they count as 1 loss each). Provincial Fleets take 
                    losses normally. When eliminating Forces consisting of a combination 
                    of Garrison Legions and Provincial Armies, 2 Provincial armies are 
                    always lost first, followed by 1 random Garrison Legion. Continue 
                    with the 2 Provincial, 1 Garrison pattern until the required number of 
                    losses has been taken (e.g., 8 losses will equate to 6 Provincial Armies

                    death of the Governor. The Province becomes allied with the victorious 
                    War, combining with it to increase the Strength of the latter by the 
                    printed Strength of the Province card and all remaining Provincial 
                    Forces. Any surviving Roman Forces are returned to Rome. However, 
                    because this was a Provincial Defeat rather than a Roman Defeat, the 
                    Unrest Level is not further affected. The surviving Provincial Forces 
                    increase the Strength of the War by one for each Army/Fleet but 
                    are not affected by multipliers for Matching Wars. These Provincial 
                    Armies/Fleets must be removed as losses first (at normal, not double, 
                    rate) in any subsequent battles. They must match Roman/friendly 
                    Provincial losses on a one-to-one basis in Stalemates/Standoffs and 
                    Naval Victories. However, they take no losses as a result of Roman/ 
                    Provincial Defeats/Disasters. The Province may not build additional 
                    Forces while allied with a War. Once this War is defeated by a non-Governor 
                    Commander, it returns to the Forum all allied Provinces, 
                    now to its Undeveloped side, and with no Provincial Forces.

                    incur an Unprosecuted War penalty during the Population Phase. It 
                    will stay Inactive until attacked by Rome or made Active by another 
                    Matching War or Leader. If there is already an Active Matching War 
                    or Leader in the Forum, the War is shuffled into the top six cards of 
                    the deck. If there are only six cards left, it is shuffled into the top of the 
                    next deck (in the case of an Extended Scenario) or discarded outright 
                    (if this is the last deck). A Provincial Victory has no effect on the 
                    Unrest Level and no Spoils of War are gained. Governors that win a
                    Provincial Victory (Land or Naval) receive standard Influence and 
                    Popularity gains. Veteran Legions are created from Garrison Legions 
                    (Provincial Armies cannot become Veteran) and owe allegiance to the 
                    Governor. A result of “Victory” in a Naval Battle that still requires 
                    a Land Battle results in a Naval Victory marker being placed on the 
                    War, and the War is considered Prosecuted for that turn.

                    Forces and Garrisons to Revolt against the Senate. This Advanced

                <p><strong>2.03.2 REBEL GOVERNOR DECLARATION:</strong> Governors may Revolt 
                    during the Revolution Phase, during the Declaration of Civil War 
                    (1.11.3). Starting with the HRAO’s Faction and proceeding clockwise, 
                    each Faction may declare a single Victorious Commander and/or 
                    one or more Governors to be in Revolt. If a Victorious Commander is 
                    declared a Rebel, he must be the Primary Rebel, otherwise, any Rebel 
                    Governor may be the Primary Rebel. The Primary Rebel may be joined 
                    by any number of Secondary Rebels belonging to the same Faction. 
                    Should a Faction that wishes to Revolt field a stronger Force than 
                    that of a previously declared Rebel, the initial Rebel’s declaration is 
                    ignored, and the player with the stronger Force is considered in Revolt

                    point of Strength in the Province’s printed Base Province Strength 
                    for maintenance. He may pay using Talents from his Personal 
                    Treasury, his Faction Treasury, or the Personal Treasuries of other 
                    Rebel Senators. Veteran Legions owing allegiance to a Rebel Senator 
                    require no maintenance. If, during the Revenue Phase, the Rebel 
                    cannot pay the required maintenance he must first release nonprovincial Legions/Fleets until he can afford to pay the maintenance. 
                    Any non-provincial Legions/Fleets that are released in this manner 
                    may be returned to the State. If the HRAO does not wish the State

                    they are immediately eliminated. If, after releasing all non-provincial

                    must release Provincial Armies/Fleets until he can afford to pay the 
                    maintenance. If he still cannot pay, he simply pays all of his money

                <p><strong>2.03.7 MARCHING ON ROME:</strong> After the Rebel Faction has been 
                    decided upon, the Primary Rebel must immediately decide if he will 
                    March on Rome. When a player declares multiple Rebel Senators in 
                    Revolt, the Forces of only the Primary Rebel may March on Rome. 
                    A Primary Rebel that is a Victorious Commander must March on 
                    Rome. A Primary Rebel Governor may decide to March on Rome or 
                    remain in his Rebel Province (2.03.8). If the Primary Rebel Governor 
                    elects to immediately March on Rome, he does not have to make a 
                    Naval Interception (2.03.72) (his Forces just land) but he may never 
                    return to his Province (though he still collects Income and Taxes). His 
                    Land Strength is equal to all his Provincial Armies [halved in value if 
                    not accompanied by a Legion (2.03.3)], loyal Veterans and Garrison 
                    Legions. If he Marches on Rome, he may not use his Province’s 
                    Base Province Strength, which remains behind on the Province. The 
                    Revolt itself is resolved as in the standard rules (1.11.37) except for 
                    Reinforcements (2.03.71) and Naval Interceptions (2.03.72).

                <p><strong>2.03.71 REINFORCEMENTS:</strong> At the beginning of every Revolution 
                    Phase following a Combat Phase where a Primary Rebel Marched on 
                    Rome achieves a “Stalemate” result, one (and only one) Secondary 
                    Rebel Governor may attempt to reinforce the Primary Rebel’s Army 
                    in Italy with any Forces he currently commands. This reinforcement 
                    does not count as an additional War, rather as an expansion of the 
                    current Civil War. The reinforcements are automatically added to 
                    the Primary Rebel’s Army if the Rebel Province has a Base Province 
                    Naval Strength of 0 (1.09.646). If the Province has a Base Province 
                    Naval Strength greater than 0, then the reinforcements are considered 
                    to be “in transit.” Reinforcements in transit are added to the Primary 
                    Rebel’s Army only if it avoids Naval Interception (2.03.72) at the 
                    beginning of the next Combat Phase. The Senate cannot attack a Rebel 
                    Province (2.03.81) if that Province has already transported Forces to 
                    Italy or has Forces in transit.

                <p><strong>2.03.72 NAVAL INTERCEPTIONS:</strong> When a Governor from a Rebel 
                    Province attempts to land in Italy or reinforce the Primary Rebel in 
                    Italy on a turn after he declares his Revolt, the Forces are subject to a 
                    Naval Interception by the Senate if its Base Province Naval Strength 
                    is greater than 0. Naval Interception battles are resolved before all
                    other battles. The Rebel’s Naval Strength consists of the Province’s 
                    Base Province Naval Strength in addition to any Provincial Fleets 
                    belonging to the reinforcing Province and all Fleets controlled by 
                    the Primary Rebel (Military ratings are not used). Provincial Fleets 
                    are always counted at full Strength. The Senate’s Strength is equal to 
                    the number of Fleets in the Active Forces boxes. If the Rebel suffers 
                    a Defeat in the Naval Interception, all his Forces remain in the Rebel 
                    Province, minus those lost in the Naval Battle. On any other result 
                    (including Stalemate), they land in Italy to attack or reinforce. Battle 
                    losses are taken equally from each side for every combat result other 
                    than “No Losses” and “ALL”. Only Fleets are subject to such losses, 
                    Mortality Chits are not drawn, and this battle has no effect on Unrest. 
                    If the Rebel has a combination of Provincial and non-Provincial Fleets, 
                    they take losses in the same way that Provincial Armies/Garrison 
                    troops take losses (2.02.411). Provincial Fleets losses can come from 
                    either the Primary Rebel’s Forces or the reinforcing Rebel Province 
                    (Rebel’s choice).

                    remains in his Province, he cannot win due to the failure of the Senate 
                    to send an Army against him or even for defeating the Army the 
                    Senate sends against him (2.03.81). He can, however, still win if the 
                    People Revolt (1.08.2) or the State Treasury goes Bankrupt (1.06.53, 
                    1.07.21). His War (in combination with all Secondary Rebels) count 
                    as one of the 4 Active Wars needed to destroy Rome and costs the 
                    State 20 Talents per turn. The Rebel Governor’s Strength is equal 
                    to the Province’s Base Province Strength plus all Provincial Forces, 
                    loyal Veterans and Garrison Legions, and Fleets he has. In a future 
                    Revolution Phase during Declaration of Civil War (1.11.3), the 
                    Primary Rebel can decide to March on Rome. If the Province has a 
                    Base Province Naval Strength greater than 0, the Senate can attempt to 
                    prevent the Primary Rebel from landing in Italy by Naval Interception 
                    (2.03.72). If the Senate does not send an Army to attack the Primary 
                    Rebel Governor remaining in his Province, that Revolt is considered 
                    Unprosecuted and will increase Unrest per the normal rules (1.10.9).

                <p>
                    EXAMPLE: Sardinia et Corsica is fully Developed and in Revolt. Its full 
                    complement of 1 Provincial Army and 5 Provincial Fleets added to its Base 
                    Province Strength of 1 Land Strength and 0 Fleet Strength gives it a total of 
                    2 Land Strength and 5 Fleet Strength. Because its Fleet Strength is greater 
                    than its Land Strength, Rome must defeat it in a Naval Battle before attacking 
                    it on land. If Rome defeats it while losing 3 fleets, the Sardinia et Corsica Fleet 
                    is also reduced by 3 and the Rebel Province gets a Naval Victory marker. The 
                    new Strength of Sardinia et Corsica for the impending Land Battle is 2 Land 
                    Strength and 2 Fleet Support. Rome must commit 2 Fleets to that battle in 
                    support of its Land Forces.

                    Once the Primary Rebel dies, all remaining Rebel resistance collapses,

                    of the Republic (1.12.3). If he defeats the Senatorial Army attacking 
                    him in his Rebel Province, he does not win the Game. For the Primary 
                    Rebel to win he must successfully attack the Senate in Italy or he may

                    commanded Veteran Legions for which he holds the Allegiance

                    retaining their Legion Allegiance markers on his card and 
                    flipping them to their disbanded side. The Legions are 
                    then placed in the Bank (not the available Force Pool) 
                    with their Veteran side up. For each Legion disbanded, 
                    the Senator increases both his Oratory and Influence by 1. 
                    When a Senator who holds the Allegiance marker of any disbanded

                    paying 10 Talents per Legion from his Personal or Faction Treasury 
                    (No Recruitment and Manpower Shortages do not affect the ability

                    its Allegiance marker on his card and decreases both his Oratory and 
                    Influence by 1. Recalled Legions retain their Veteran status and must 
                    be maintained by the Senate at the normal rate.

                    Once enacted, the provisions of the Law apply as normal, although 
                    several Laws have slightly different effects (as noted on the card) 
                    when using this rule. Display Enacted Law cards as you would

                <i>
                    REPUBLIC OF ROME offers three main scenarios which cover Rome’s rise 
                    from a city-state on the banks of the Tiber to an empire that dominated the 
                    entire Mediterranean. The main scenarios are labeled the Early, Middle, and 
                    Late Republic. The Early Republic features a fragile Republic beset by the 
                    most powerful enemies it would ever have to face, and the players must work 
                    hard simply to survive. The Middle Republic is a period of growth, in which a 
                    stable Rome absorbs more and more provinces, and the threats it faces slowly 
                    become more internal than external. The Late Republic portrays the final 
                    cataclysmic days of the Republic, as powerful politicians face-off for control 
                    of the state while Italy is wracked by dissent, Civil War threatens, and the 
                    Roman Republic lurches towards the Roman Empire.

                <i>
                    It is generally suggested that new players should start with the Early 
                    Republic scenario (3.01.1). Even though it is the toughest for the Republic, 
                    it plays in 4 hours or so for most groups. It uses the fewest rules and is an 
                    excellent way to become familiar with the dynamics of the game. The Middle 
                    and Late Republic scenarios each take a bit longer to play than the previous 
                    scenario, although the very real threat of the Republic becoming an Empire 
                    can cut the Late Republic short.

                <p><strong>3.04.1 EXTENDED SCENARIO:</strong> Rather than simply playing one 
                    scenario, continue into the Middle (or Late) Republic by shuffling 
                    the second (or third) deck from that period and placing it in play. 
                    Players may play just two decks (Early to Middle or Middle to Late) 
                    or opt for the complete extended Game (Early to Middle to Late). Play 
                    proceeds normally after noting the increased Legion Loyalty numbers 
                    for Revolts (1.11.31) and the new Random Events Table column in use 
                    for the new period. The Game is considered to be in the Middle or 
                    Late period the moment a card is drawn from that deck (the drawing 
                    player must announce he drew from the new period). Setup should be 
                    done for the first deck only according to the starting Scenario for that 
                    deck, except that the placement of the “Era Ends” card should be done 
                    by using the Era Ends placement rule for the ending Scenario deck.
                </p>
                <p>EXAMPLE: If doing the Extended Scenario from the Middle to Late 
                    scenarios, follow all the steps in the Middle Republic Scenario (3.02) except 
                    for steps (3.02.2 G and 3.02.2 H). Instead, use step (3.03.2 H) from the Late 
                    Republic Scenario (3.03) to place the Era Ends card.</p>

                    as the Early Republic Scenario (3.01), except ignore all deck borders

                    to the Conservatives, and 1 extra Senator to the Populists. Make 
                    the Plutocrat Senator with the most Influence the Temporary Rome

                    Forces only in a Crisis (4.05.3). Given adequate finances, Rome will 
                    always build as many Forces as needed to implement the Military 
                    Plan. If unable to build sufficient Forces to implement the defined 
                    Military Plan, builds are the prerogative of the Dominate Player.

                    and Master of Horse are decided before the division of Spoils. Once 
                    decided, the division of Spoils proceeds with the strongest Faction 
                    of the Ruling Coalition, regardless of who received the Dictator 
                    and Master of Horse. In a Crisis, only the Senator with the highest 
                    Military rating is eligible for Dictator (regardless of whether he is 
                    part of the Ruling Coalition). Any Statesman who is immune to 
                    Disaster or Standoff against the War in question wins ties as the 
                    most eligible. Only the Senator with the next highest Military rating 
                    is eligible for a Neutral Dictator’s Master of Horse (without regard to 
                    Disaster immunity or membership in the Ruling Coalition). In a 
                    Crisis, only the remaining Senators with the highest Military ratings 
                    of each Faction are eligible for Consul. Those with the least Influence 
                    win ties among the best Military Senators of that Faction.

                    (from highest to lowest). After the Ruling Coalition Faction with the 
                    least votes has chosen, a new round starts with the one with the most 
                    votes, and so on until all Spoils have been divided. Neutral Factions 
                    choose their Spoils in the order listed on their “Spoils” Guideline. 
                    Unlike a Neutral, a Player may choose to give his Spoils to any Senator

            <div class="col-md-12 pb-2">
                <p><strong>4.08.1 HOW TO WIN:</strong> The Victory Conditions are unchanged from 
                    the Basic Game. The Player has many seeming advantages over his 
                    predictable Neutral opponents due to his greater freedom of action 
                    and ability to inspect their Intrigue cards and Faction Treasury. 
                    Balancing this somewhat is the burden of keeping the Republic 
                    afloat. The Neutrals tend to be self-serving so the Player must lead 
                    the way, often spending not to enrich his Faction but to safeguard 
                    the Republic. For instance, it is not unusual for the Plutocrats to use 
                    their head start as the Temporary Rome Consul to forge a monopoly 
                    on the Censor as long as they remain in the Ruling Coalition. The 
                    Player may find it necessary to sacrifice his own Spoils pick to give 
                    a Consulship to a lesser Senator among the Plutocrats in order to 
                    qualify someone else in that Faction for Censor and thereby slow the 
                    Influence gain of the original Temporary Rome Consul. Indeed, the 
                    Player may consider it a moral victory if he can keep the Republic 
                    intact until Scenario end regardless of how his own Faction fares.

            <p class="col-md-12">REPUBLIC OF ROME was always known to have an infamous long list of errata, both official and unofficial. The changes listed below reflect 
                actual changes between this latest edition compared to the original game combined with the official Avalon Hill errata. Differences between 
                the original and the current rulebooks that are not reflected below are likely detailed in official errata compiled over the last twenty years by 
                fans and are available (with some searching) on the internet. Keep in mind that terminology changes and cosmetic changes have not been listed 
                here. Only mechanical changes to the game are listed.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li> The game now ends in the Forum Phase when the “Era Ends” Event is drawn instead of at the end of the turn after the last card is drawn from 
                    the deck. The change results in slightly different deck construction as well as changes any rule or card that mentioned reshuffling the deck.
                    <div>Reason for Change: To limit the artificial Assassination free-for-all that occurs at the end of the game.</div>
                <li> Revenue transfers between players moved to the Personal Income step in the Revenue Phase.
                    <div>Reason for Change: To simplify the Revenue Phase and to ensure that players could not get out of Public Agreements by contributing to 
                    the State first.</div>
                <li>Corrupt Governors can now be prosecuted even when recalled in the Senate Phase.
                    <div>Reason for Change: To remove the “loophole” where Corrupt Governors could avoid at least the threat of a prosecution.</div>
                <li>Factions with two opposing Statesmen may now not voluntarily abandon one of them.
                    <div>Reason for Change: This is to remove numerous rules questions that arise from “abandoning” a Senator – something that is extremely rare.</div>
                <li>Removed the chart and DR for determining how many Provincial Armies vs. Legions are taken for battle losses in a mixed force and replaced 
                    them with a pattern of 1 Legion for every 2 Provincial Armies.
                    <div>Reason for Change: To simplify the way losses are taken in Provincial Wars.</div>
                <li>Removed the official “Banker” position.
                    <div>Reason for Change: Players may now hand out money from the Bank as they see fit. If they would like a “Banker” role they may 
                    appoint one amongst themselves.</div>
                <li>The Exile rules have been removed.
                    <div>Reason for Change: Exiles were (for the most part) never used and didn’t contribute anything to game play.</div>
                <li>The loss of Legions in battle incurs a minor Popularity loss.
                    <div>Reason for Change: To simultaneously allow an alternative method besides minor Prosecutions to lower the Popularity on highly 
                    popular Senators and to more accurately simulate the consequences of military troop losses.</div>
                <li>The Temporary Rome Consul is no longer assigned to the Senator with the lowest ID# but instead is randomly determined.
                    <div>Reason for Change: To limit the advantage of the player controlling ID#1 at the very beginning of the Early Republic Scenario. </div>
                <li>Players now track who is available for minor/major prosecutions with markers and by adjusting concession cards.
                    <div>Reason for Change: This was included to remove the memory portion of the Censors job ( i.e., “Who is eligible for prosecution again?”) 
                    but it does add some additional fiddliness. Players as a group can decide to use these markers as they see fit.</div>
                <li>Talents in the Faction Treasury cannot be used to aid the attacker of a Persuasion Attempt.
                    <div>Reason for Change: The original rulebook and player aids had contradictions on this subject. Subsequent AH errata confirmed that they 
                    could aid the attacker though much of the REPUBLIC OF ROME community assumed this was an incorrect answer and never played this
                    way due to the perceived potential negative effects and loops holes that this created. We have decided that allowing additional Factions to 
                    aid the attacker of a persuasion attempt gives an excessive advantage to the attacker and significantly increases the chaos of persuasions 
                    attempts.</div>
                <li>Matching Wars Time Delay Variant Rule is made Official Rule (Imminent Wars).
                    <div>Reason for Change: The AH General magazine released a variant that delayed a Matching War from becoming Active immediately if 
                    there already was a Matching War of the same type in play. This extremely popular variant rule was considered by most players
                    to be necessary in order to have a fighting chance in many of the harder scenarios. It has since become standard in most games and has 
                    now been made official. These delayed wars are now referred to as Imminent Wars.</div>
                <li>Changing Faction Leader and Sponsoring Games are no longer either/or options.
                    <div>Reason for Change: Our view of the rule in which you could not Change Faction leaders if you Sponsored games was that it was 
                    arbitrary, anti-intuitive and takes players out of the immersion. After extensive debate internally and with the designer it was decided 
                    that taking this unusual restrictions out of the rules would have little to no impact and streamline a small but rather glaring oddity.</div>
                <li>Assignment/Reassignment of a Priest by the Pontifex is now optional.
                    <div>Reason for Change: The original wording indicated that the Pontifex must assign or reassign 1 Priest every turn. Unfortunately, 
                    sometimes the Pontifex would simply forget, leaving the players to wonder if they should just ignore the mistake or correct it 
                    immediately. Making this action optional removes this problem and should have no real effect on the game.</div>
